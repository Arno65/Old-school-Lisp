# Old School Lisp

  Creating code in  Lisp / Scheme  like in the 'old days'

  First project is working on a chess-engine.\
  For this I'm using DrRacket (#lang scheme).

  This is a learning project.\
  It's a work in progress and at the moment the code is a bit of a mess...\ 
  Learn old-school Lisp programming.\
  Am I able to build a chess engine?

    How to:
    Place all Scheme (.scm) files into a project directory.
    "chess.scm" is the main file.
    Load this in DrRacket and run.
